While our community is always welcome to contribute, please note that
new feature development happens outside of this repo which means that

make sure that all code that is pushed here has passed our rigorous QA
testing and high security standards. That being said, weâ€™ll do our best
to take note of feature requests or additions  some of which we might
potentially incorporate into our codebase via our main development pipeline.
